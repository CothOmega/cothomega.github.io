		<h1>Week 1 Technical Blog</h1>
		<h2>Tumblr.com</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Simply put, I love this site because it is where I go to unwind.</li>
			<li>When first logging in, your eyes are drawn to your subscribed content. This is definitely the most important place on the page because this is literally the reason you are here.</li>
			<li>Visually, the website is very vertically oriented. This leads to much scrolling as you get to older content. I would also call it very minimalist. Once you have begun scrolling, all you see is your content; no ads or anything like that.</li>
			<li>I would try to best describe Tumblr as fun, relaxed, uncluttered, fast-paced, and effective.</li>
			<li>After a while on the site, you might begin to feel overwhelmed as you keep scrolling. Or you will reach content that you have already seen before. But as soon as you hit the home button and refresh your list, the adventure begins anew.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Gmail.com</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Gmail is where I go to be productive. Especially now! I receive a large amount of emails, so I need Gmail to be effective.</li>
			<li>Which it is! That is the major way I would describe it. As soon as you are logged in, you see your messages. No extra menus to go through. Nothing is in the way. Very uncluttered.</li>
			<li>Gmail is also oriented very vertically. You have your sidebar of categories, but your main content is all vertical.</li>
			<li>Gmail is one of those sites where you can just get in and get out. You shouldn't need to spend large amounts of time here, unless you really have a lot of things coming in or lots of emails to compose.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>DumbingOfAge.com</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>DumbingOfAge (DOA) is a comic that I have been reading for years. Again, I go here to relax.</li>
			<li>Upon arrival your eyes are drawn to the comic strip, which of course is the key location. </li>
			<li>The site is organized well, but it does feel a bit cluttered once you are below the comic. It jumbles sidebars or large ads and image links to more of the Author's comics. Also tucked in here are relevant surverys and news posts.</li>
			<li>The main themes of the site are silliness and clutter. Luckily for me, my main focus for visiting is the comic strip, but the other elements of the site become somewhat unbearable.</li>
		</ul>
