<h2>Peer Pairing</h2>
<h3>Emotions</h3>
<p>One emotion I find myself floating to is stress. My personality is not one that continually seeks out others for assistance or advice. But I can also say that has been one of my biggest growing points throughout this adventure. I am learning more and more that my peers are a source of vast knowledge and experience. And I am very much the kind of person that, once a benefit has been located, will attempt to use it to its most effective end. And I am learning how to communicate my own needs/ desires more effectively as well. Between forming closer interpersonal bonds and asking relevant questions, peer pairning has been going so much better than I could have hoped. I still get a bit stressed out when working with others simply because of my nature, but I am able to contain this and be an effective partner and contribute.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie: I really enjoy reading my feedbacks. 1) Because I get so paranoid about being an effective partner during pairing, I tend to fear the worst. 2) Seeing that my partners have unamimously agreed that I am an asset just gives me such a feeling of confidence. Knowing that others can see the effort I put out makes me realize that I really am picking up these varied and difficult skills. I will very much agree that the feedback has been helpful. And of the advice that was given, I have been able to modulate my pairing techniques to be even more effective.</p>
