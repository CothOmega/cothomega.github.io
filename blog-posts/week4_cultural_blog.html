<article><h2>Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>Sadly, this is an issue that is getting a lot of publicity lately. Not sad because of the coverage, but because nothing seems to be changing! Currently, the FCC is attempting move forward on measure to create a 2-tiered style to Internet speed. Primarily, this leads to a "fast lane" and a "slow lane" through the Internet. This would allow ISPs to charge a premium fee for people for speedy access to a site. Large corporations would of course be able to pay these fees, but the one of the largest strengths the Internet had was its level playing field. A start-up with small revenue will not be able to compete with larger firms when their service may only be going a fraction of the speed! It is quite easy to ramble on about this subject, but recently John Oliver on his new series <em>Last Week Tonight</em> released a very light-hearted yet educational video on the entire subject. Definitely worth a watch.</p>

<p>It is my greatest hope that the FCC's measures do not come to pass. The best way to resolve this 'problem' is to not allow it to take root in the first place! Like Oliver mentions, the FCC is taking public comments on this issue at <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/comments">FCC.gov/Comments</a> under "Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet", so please make your voice heard. Theoretically, this affects us too! If we move on from DBC into the private sector with a service to promote, we definitely want a level playing field with the big dogs.</p>
