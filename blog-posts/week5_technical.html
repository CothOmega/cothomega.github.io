<h2>Classes: How? What? WHY?!</h2>
	<p>Classes in Ruby are invaluable tools that can save you tons of time and efforts when compiling large chunks of code. Think of a class as a blueprint in which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, you could think of your home as in instance of the <em>class of objects</em> known as homes. Let's actually see this implemented, though!</p>

	<p>There. Finished. We made a class! Let's go home!<br><br>What, you want it to do something? Sure, no problem. Let's go ahead and start adding details about our Home.</p>

	<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WyUCJWA.jpg">

	<p>So here we have added the ability for our Home class to contain the instance variables <em>bedrooms</em>, <em>bathrooms</em>, and <em>floors</em>. Not bad for just a few lines of code. But homes are not eternally static entities. They can change! Heck, let's imagine you have a child on the way. Time to add more space with a new bedroom. And we can definitely account for that in Ruby.</p>

	<p>So now that our Home class has the ability to add more bedrooms we can implement that! All we have to do it call our class with its parameters. Then, we follow that with our freshly-made <code>add_bed</code> method.</p>

	<p>Sure, this is a very basic example of classes and how they work, but that is one of the best things about classes. They can be as much or as little as you need them to be! So take this primer, and <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_classes.htm">learn more about classes here!</a></p>
