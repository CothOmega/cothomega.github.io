		<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p>Learning of this idea was kind of eye-opening for me. I mean, there is no doubt in my mind that I, as a privledged white male, haven't experienced nearly the same level of stereotype threat as...nearly anyone else. And honestly, it feels kind of difficult to write about how it has effected me without seeming like a pretentious ass. That being said, let's give it a shot.</p>
			<p>I have loved technology all my life. From computers to video games, I was always the go-to guy for tech stuff. And at this current juncture, that is actually starting to feel weird. My family knows about DBC and what my goals are, but I don't think they really comprehend how difficult some of this stuff is. I try to explain  it to them, but since they really had no technological savvy in the past this new stuff just sails over their head. They assume since I have always been good with "that there tech-stuff I don't understand" that this will all just go swimmingly. And I do hope it does! But I feel the pressure of their casual dismissal of my fears. "Oh you'll get it in no time, I'm sure it's easy once you think about it." REALLY? Based off what, Aunt Ruth? That time I had to program your 12 year old VCR? This is a whole different game! It's hard to expect tech-empathy from someone like that.</p>
			<p>*end rant*</p>
			<p>But those are just some things I feel aware of. The assumption -- nay <em>expectation</em> of success doesn't feel good. And I know they all mean well with their talk, but any time I have problems on a challenge or GPS that is literally the first thing to come into my head.
				<br><em>"Come on. You should know this. This is Phase 0. Not even in class yet. Should be a breeze..."</em><br>
				Even though it is designed to be hard and I've known the topic for a few days maybe. I just need to learn to manage my inner monologue and go with the process. Normally not too difficult, but we all have those days...</p>
