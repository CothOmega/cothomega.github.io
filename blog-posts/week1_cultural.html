			<p>This fireside chat was super fantastic for my mental state! Once Shereef explained the Kitchen vs Table idea, it just CLICKED! I can already tell you I had just totally envisioned experiencing DBC from a consumer mindset. It actually put me at ease to a large degree, at least emotionally. From the technology aspect, I still feel so overwhelmed. And that excites me. I feel that I have been coasting through my life for a while now. DBC just seems like the perfect environmen to grow.</p>
			<p>Knowing that I am not expected to know everything in advance is nice. And I even know now that this was never expected of me, but that's just how my brain deals with things it doesn't totally understand. I blow things up, and freak myself out. But even just hearing Shereef acknowledge my fears is so helpful. The intro session excited me, but this fireside chat has got me bursting at the seams! And super nervous! Anxiety! Fear? I want to learn.</p>
