		<h2>Values</h2>
			<p>There are a number of traits I can pinpoint from the times in my life where I have been happiest, proudest, or most satisfied:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Control</li>
					<li>Efficiency</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
					<li>Loyalty</li>
					<li>Personal development</li>
					<li>Reputation</li>
					<li>Self-knowledge</li>
					<li>Wisdom</li>
				</ul>
			<p>These are values I hold dear, and there is not an instance where I do not endeavor to make them a more prominent focus in my life.</p>
		<h2>Advice</h2>	
			<p>The last person I gave advice to was actually my mother. She was seeking my expertise on how to fix an aspect of her social media site. Primarily, that someone was bugging her nonstop, and she was about to close her account because of them. I helped her calm down and showed her how we could remove that person from her site and they would no longer even be able to see her page. This made her happy, because she did not want to lose touch with friends due to the unpleasantness of one person. Sometimes, it just takes a little perspective.</p>
		<h2>Coping</h2>	
			<p>I like to consider myself a very collected person. Not quite stoic, but I really like to keep to myself. When I get down, I normally tend to medicate with video games. It allows me to take my mind off my problems and cool down. Sadly, I won't be able to bring my entire computer setup halfway across the nation, but I will manage!</p>
