		<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
	<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png"/><br>
	<p>SQL injection is a method of web attack used primarily to steal/tamper with data. It has become increasingly common and takes advantage of improper coding of web apps. The hacker will use SQL commands anywhere user input is allowed and attempt to find holes in the sites defenses.</p>
	<p>This issue is a definite problem, especially with how common it has become to keep large portions of our secure data online. Imagine even trying to purchase something off Amazon if the threat of having your credit card information was as easy as typing one little command.</p>
	<p>Luckily, SQL injection can be prevented with proper coding techniques. Numerous methods can be employed, but the primary idea is to think ahead of your attackers. Leave nothing to chance! I found a website that actually detailed a security team's attempts to SQL inject a client's intranet and managed it with ease. They also list their <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html#miti">thoughts on mitigating attacks</a> which was very useful. Give it a read to see their methods!</p>
