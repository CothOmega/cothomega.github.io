		<h2>Emotional Conflict</h2>
		<p>Conflict is something I tend to seek to avoid. My nature tends to have me be the first one to step back and try to evaluate why a confrontation is even happening. The last conflict I had with someone was my fiance just a week ago. I was stressing out about my upcoming move to New York for Dev Bootcamp, and was isolating myself pretty hard. I was focused on the uncertainties of the future vs the Now. She didn't appreciate this mainly because she knew she would be losing me for almost 3 months, and the last thing she wanted to see was me hiding away in our final weeks together.</p>
		<p>Luckily, we were able to handle the situation by discussing the issue. She let me know how she was feeling, and how my actions were causing it. I was glad that we talked, because I was so far gone that I wasn't picking up on the hints. I was able to rationalize my actions and come back. We made our final days together memorable to try and make the time apart bearable.</p>
		<p>Here, I was primarily reminded of my nature-- I withdrawal into my head. And once you are there, it can be tough to get out without outside assistance. And for that I am thankful.</p>
