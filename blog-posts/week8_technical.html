		<h2>What is Rails?</h2>
		<p>When I first heard about the language Ruby, it was introduced to me as 'Ruby on Rails'. At the time, that meant absolutely nothing to me. Now, after weeks of working with Ruby I think it is fair to find out exactly what Rails is! Most information here will be pulled directly from <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">RubyonRails.org's guide</a>.</p>
		<p>To begin, Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. One of its claims to fame is that it allows you to write less code while doing more than other languages and frameworks. Rails also assumes that there is a 'best way' to code, and it encourages this behavior to increase productivity. Bringing old habits into the Rails environment can apparently lead to bad times. The 2 major philosophies behind Rails are DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code and "Convention over Configuration"-- the idea of sticking to best coding practices without worrying about endless configuration files.</p>
		<p>And, at least at a glance, those are the key ideas of Rails. Keep it simple and concise.</p>
