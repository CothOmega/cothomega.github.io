<h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is widely used for various reasons. It has uses in client-side interaction as well as server-side development. It has also risen to be a major card in mobile app development. And when mixed with AJAX, we gain lots of ability in manipulating DOM elements and making database calls.</p>
<p>JS can have some downsides, though. From things I have read, it doesn't seem to excel at large databases or huge enterprise apps. I honestly don't know enough from personal interaction, but I found more than one internet flame war of people arguing: one side that JS was the future of all coding, the other arguing that JS doesn't even qualify as a "good" programming language. Check it <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise#awesm=~oFXls5YWU2wBFl">here</a> if you like.</p>
