		<h1>Wireframing</h1>
		<h2>Tumblr.com</h2>

		<p>The main purpose this site is solving is showing you your subscribed content. Visually, there are many aspects to your own Tumblr account/ navigation tools they have to show you, but not detracting from the main reason you are there, i.e. the content.

		<h2>Gmail.com</h2>
		<p><a href="http://imgur.com/VhTVYG3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VhTVYG3.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a></p>
		<p>Gmail has to solve getting my email to me efficientyly. There can be no mistakes as far as 'what is unread' vs 'have I read this, or is it important?'.</p>

		<h2>DumbingOfAge.com</h2>

		<p>DumbingOfAge is a comic, so the primary goal the author has is displaying the comic BUT to also make money via ad revenue and merchandising. The layout definitely presents itself to focus on the comic, but his money-makers are right there as well.</p>
