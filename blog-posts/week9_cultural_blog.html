		<h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
			<p>I feel like I ask good questions...when I ask them. I would say that one thing my History degree gave me was a stubbornness for research. I commonly poured over books, sites, or text to find answers. And since I would be working on something very specific, there wouldn't necessarily always be a resource where I could go to and find a straight answer. Coding is much different than that. Especially with being a newbie. The biggest things I learned in the past that continue to help now are copious details and detailed steps of things I have already done. If you can let someone know <em>exactly</em> what you have done so far, you can proceed forward without backtracking.</p>
			<p>Some of the most unhelpful questions include "What did I do wrong?" and "Why is this happening?" Without <em>any</em> details as to what has been done so far. I mean, yes you can provide a link to your code, but tell us what you did. Has it always done this? Is there a time in which it worked? What did you change since then?? The list goes on. Be as thorough as possible! We want to help! :D</p>
