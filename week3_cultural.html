<h2>Abstract Sequential</h2>

<p>I have known I was an Abstract Sequential thinker for some time. Back in high school, I took a career test before accepting my college acceptance. I wanted to know that I mentally fit into where I was planning to be. Sadly, that didn't exactly work out as planned in that instance, but it has definitely helped give me perspective ocer the years.</p>
<p>So far, my style has lended my some benefits to the way Phase 0 is layed out. Two of the bigger aspects I play to often include heavily relying on reference material and my success when working alone. But we can already see where that would cause issue. I am a very strong introvert, and the pairing process has definitely taken me out of my comfort zone. I totally recognize the benefits of the task, but that doesn't make it easy for me. I have actually even rescheduled some of my pair groups due to sheer anxiety over working intimately with other people. I always overcome it, but it can be trying.</p>
<p>Introspection is a good tool to have at your disposal. Focusing on my strengths and shoring up my weaknesses will help ensure DBC is successful for me.</p>
